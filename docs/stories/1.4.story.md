# Epic 1: Project Setup & Foundational Backend
# Story 1.4: Create Dockerfile for Backend Containerization

## Status: To Do

## Story

As a Developer, I want to create a Dockerfile for the backend so that we can have a consistent and reproducible environment for development and deployment.

## Dev Notes

### Architecture

*   **Containerization:** The backend application must be containerized using Docker to ensure a consistent runtime environment across all stages (development, testing, production). [Source: docs/architecture/backend.md]
*   **Optimization:** The Dockerfile should use multi-stage builds to create a small, optimized production image, reducing deployment times and surface area. [Source: Epic 1 Technical Requirements]

### Project Structure

*   The `Dockerfile` must be located at the root of the `backend/` directory.

## Tasks / Subtasks

1.  [x] Create a `backend/Dockerfile`.
2.  [x] Implement a multi-stage build:
    *   A `builder` stage to install dependencies, including development tools if necessary.
    *   A final, slim production stage that copies only the application code and necessary dependencies from the `builder` stage.
3.  [x] Ensure the `Dockerfile` correctly copies the `app/` directory and `requirements.txt`.
4.  [x] The final image should expose the correct port (e.g., 80) and define the `CMD` to run the application using `uvicorn`.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  [x] A `Dockerfile` exists in the `backend/` directory.
2.  [x] The Docker image can be built successfully using `docker build -t bitcoin-dominance-backend .` from the `backend/` directory.
3.  [x] The resulting Docker container runs the FastAPI application without errors when started with `docker run`.
4.  [x] The application running inside the container is accessible from the host machine.
