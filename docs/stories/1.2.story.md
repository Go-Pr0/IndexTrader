# Epic 1: Project Setup & Foundational Backend
# Story 1.2: Implement Pydantic Settings Management

## Status: To Do

## Story

As a Developer, I want to implement Pydantic settings management so that we can handle configuration securely and flexibly for different environments.

## Dev Notes

### Architecture

*   **Configuration:** The backend service will use Pydantic's Settings Management for robust configuration handling. All configuration values will be loaded from environment variables. [Source: docs/architecture/backend.md]
*   **File Location:** All settings logic should be centralized in `backend/app/core/config.py`.
*   **Pydantic Version:** This implementation should use Pydantic V2, which separates settings management into the `pydantic-settings` package.

### Project Structure

*   Create a new file for settings at `backend/app/core/config.py`.
*   The `Settings` class will manage application-wide configurations.

## Tasks / Subtasks

1.  [x] Create the `backend/app/core/config.py` file.
2.  [x] In `config.py`, define a `Settings` class that inherits from `pydantic_settings.BaseSettings`.
3.  [x] Add initial configuration variables such as `PROJECT_NAME` and `API_V1_STR`.
4.  [x] Update `backend/app/main.py` to import and use the settings instance.
5.  [x] Add `pydantic-settings` to the `backend/requirements.txt` file.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  [x] A `config.py` file exists at `backend/app/core/config.py` and contains a Pydantic `Settings` class.
2.  [x] The application successfully loads configuration from environment variables via the `Settings` class.
3.  [x] The main application (`main.py`) initializes and uses the settings object.
4.  [x] The `pydantic-settings` package is included in `backend/requirements.txt`.
