# Story 1.1: Setup FastAPI application with a modular structure

## Status: Done

## Story

As a Developer, I want to set up a FastAPI application with a modular structure so that we can build a maintainable and scalable backend.

## Dev Notes

### Architecture

*   **Monolith:** The backend will be a modular monolith. This approach provides development simplicity for the MVP while still separating concerns into distinct logical modules. [Source: docs/architecture/backend.md]
*   **Configuration:** The backend service will use Pydantic's Settings Management for robust configuration handling. All configuration values will be loaded from environment variables. [Source: docs/architecture/backend.md]
*   **Database Migrations:** All changes to the PostgreSQL database schemas will be managed using **Alembic**. [Source: docs/architecture/database.md]
*   **Framework**: The backend will be built with **FastAPI (Python 3.11+)**. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
*   **Formatting**: All Python code **must** be formatted using `black`. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
*   **Type Hinting**: All function signatures and variable declarations **must** include type hints. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Project Structure

*   The project structure should follow the guidelines in `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`.
*   Create the main application directory: `backend/app/`
*   Create the following modules within `backend/app/`:
    *   `api/`
    *   `core/`
    *   `db/`
    *   `services/`
    *   `workers/`
*   Create the FastAPI application entry point at `backend/app/main.py`.

## Tasks / Subtasks

1.  [x] Initialize a new FastAPI project in the `backend/` directory.
2.  [x] Create the directory structure as specified in the "Project Structure" notes above. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
3.  [x] Create a basic "hello world" endpoint in `backend/app/main.py` to verify the application is running.
4.  [x] Add `fastapi` and `uvicorn` to the `backend/requirements.txt` file.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The FastAPI application can be started successfully using `uvicorn`.
2.  A `backend/` directory exists with the initial project structure.
3.  The application is structured into the following modules: `api`, `core`, `db`, `services`, `workers`.
4.  The `backend/requirements.txt` file includes `fastapi` and `uvicorn`.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2024-08-01
### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment
The initial implementation is good and follows the basic structure outlined in the story. It provides a solid foundation.

### Refactoring Performed
- **File**: `backend/requirements.txt`
  - **Change**: Pinned dependency versions.
  - **Why**: To ensure reproducible builds across all environments.
  - **How**: Used `pip freeze` to capture the exact versions of the installed packages.
- **File**: `backend/app/main.py`
  - **Change**: Added module and function-level docstrings.
  - **Why**: To comply with the project's coding standards which require docstrings for all public modules and functions.
  - **How**: Added Google-style docstrings explaining the purpose of the module and the root endpoint.
