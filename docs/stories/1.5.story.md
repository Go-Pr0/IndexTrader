# Epic 1: Project Setup & Foundational Backend
# Story 1.5: Define Initial render.yaml for Infrastructure

## Status: To Do

## Story

As a Developer, I want to define the initial `render.yaml` structure so that we have a clear, version-controlled plan for our cloud infrastructure.

## Dev Notes

### Architecture

*   **Infrastructure as Code:** The `render.yaml` file will serve as the source of truth for our infrastructure configuration on Render, enabling consistent and repeatable deployments. [Source: Epic 1 Technical Requirements]
*   **Services:** The initial plan must account for all core backend services required by the application.

### Project Structure

*   The `render.yaml` file must be located at the root of the project repository.

## Tasks / Subtasks

1.  [x] Create the `render.yaml` file at the project root.
2.  [x] Define a **Web Service** for the FastAPI backend, referencing the `backend/` directory and its `Dockerfile`.
3.  [x] Define two **PostgreSQL** instances: `user-db` and `general-db`.
4.  [x] Define a **Redis** instance for caching and potential future task queuing.
5.  [x] Define a **Background Worker** service (e.g., for Celery), even if the implementation is deferred.
6.  [x] Define a **Secret File** to store the master encryption key, ensuring it is properly mounted to the web service.
7.  [x] Link the services using environment variables (e.g., `DATABASE_URL_USER` should point to the `user-db` connection string).

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  [x] A `render.yaml` file exists at the project root.
2.  [x] The file defines all the required services: Web Service, two PostgreSQL databases, Redis, a Background Worker, and a Secret File.
3.  [x] The database and Redis connection details are correctly passed to the web service via environment variables.
4.  [x] The file is syntactically correct and passes Render's validation (this can be checked manually or via a PR to Render).
